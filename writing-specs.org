* About Missing Link Tutorials

I find a lot of technology doesn't have documentation that I can
relate to.  The style of Missing Link Tutorials is to be clear,
succint, easy, and to cover concepts and essential practical aspects
of the topic.  Without further ado...


* A function special

Lets say we have a function that expects a map that could be called in
one of two ways:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(authenticated {:username "abc" :password "123"})

;; -- OR --

(authenticated {:token "1a2b3c"})
#+END_SRC

First lets define a basic spec

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(s/def ::date inst?)
#+END_SRC

This creates a spec called ~date~ that we could use on a piece of data
like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

#+END_SRC
